PLD New Rescue
==============

Bootable disk image with 'live' [PLD Linux](http://www.pld-linux.org/) system
aimed especially for system rescue and maintenance.

This project is inspired by the original [PLD Rescue CD](http://rescuecd.pld-linux.org/)

This is still work in progress.

Goals
-----

* The image should be compatible with modern computers. This means 64-bit and
  EFI support.

* The image should be compatible with old computers. This means 32-bit support
  and low memory requirements.

* It should be as easy to boot it from a USB disk as from a CD

* Setting up a network boot (PXE, including EFI PXE) should be easy too.

* Everyone familiar with PLD Linux should be able to build and customize 
  the image.
